# Nisarga Adhikary

Hey there 👋 I'm Nisarga, a 16 year old tech enthusiast & high school science student from Indi. 

I enjoy working with frameworks like Next.js and crafting beautiful apps & websites. Programming is my hobby, which eventually became my passion.
I mostly code in Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Go, Bash & CSS. I love working on automation, APIs & robots.
I am experienced with stuff like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud etc. I am a huge Linux and open source software fan. I ocassionally solve DSA challenges & take part in CTF competitions. I also spend my time ricing my Linux. I love to read English literature & solving math problems XD.
I contribute to open source projects when I'm not busy with my studies & assignments. I also maintain some open source projects on GitHub.
I love solving maths, exploring physics and watching anime apart from playing with computers and coding. My want to become a software developer, cybersecurity professional or an entrepeneur. I am currently focusing on my just my **studies**.
